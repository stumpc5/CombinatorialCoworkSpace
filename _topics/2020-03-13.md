## Friday, 2020-03-13

The last day dawned bright and clear, but only in our hopes and dreams. In the very last session of the workshop, 
Marta Panizzut explained the connection between classical cubic surfaces and tropical ones, and then we heard from 
Jorge Alberto Olarte about tropical linear spaces and transversal valuated matroids. 

Summarized:

And suddenly it was time for many goodbyes (without too many hugs)! It has been a great week, and we personally hope to see you all soon :)

Time to shred!
Giulia and Lorenzo

PS: Some people were still spotted on the sun-patchworked slopes in the afternoon....

PPS: We have proof that some people were still up and about after dinner. Proof also that fascist italian soft drinks 
have infiltrated the Alps!
