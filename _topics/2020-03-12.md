## Thursday, 2020-03-12

Sad news await us on Thursday: due to travelling issues caused by the corona virus, the cowork space has been shortened, and a few talks have to be cancelled. We wish a safe trip back to all who left Haus Begrkranz!

The organizers left the morning free for discussion and collaboration. Someone decided to bring this meetings on a hike trail or on the ski slopes.

(another friend left us :( )

Back on track for the afternoon session: from Kolja Knauer we learned how oriented matroids naturally can be arranged into complexes. Petra Schwer then showed us folding properties of Coxeter complexes.


After a typical (?) Bavarian dinner, we met again in the seminar room. We took a survivors' picture (everyone's still looking good!):

Martin Winter talked about inscribed zonotopes and how they are related congruent chambers in arrangements. Before the last open mic session, the generous organizers invited us for a drink (Dankeschön!:) ).

Prost! And thank you!

At the open mic, there was a lot of talent on display. In particular, we feel we cannot avoid showcasing Robert Löwe's regular triangulations!

P.s.: There are rumors of salsa music and smell of beer coming from the basement. That is everything we're allowed to say...
