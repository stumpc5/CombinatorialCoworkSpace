Polytopes dominated our morning session: Benjamin Nill and Johannes Hofscheier introduced basic notions and central results about lattice polytopes and Ehrhart theory. Then they made us work :(

Some people then braved the weather, while others (maybe cleverer) enjoyed the comforts of modern life or started new collaborations...

Later in the day, Karim Adiprasito continued his tutorial, and gave an overview of key ingredients of his proof of the g-theorem for spheres.

And that's another day folks! We're off to the open mic session....
