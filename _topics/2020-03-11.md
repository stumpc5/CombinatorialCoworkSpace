## Wednesday, 2020-03-11

We don't quite know what happened down in Haus Bergkranz this morning, since most of us braved the drizzle and headed out into the snow!

(We even met old friends...<img src="./pics/snowman.jpg" width="100"> )


After a dejavu lunch, and productive collaboration time in the common rooms, it was time for the second lattice tutorial. This time Christian Haase and Paco Santos told us about adding points in lattice polytopes and questions around width and hollowness. The afternoon proceeded with a (very punctual!) talk by Lukas KÃ¼hne, who told us about positive progress on a conjecture on c-arrangements he and coauthors disbelieve.

For the first time this week, a pale sun appeared at the horizon.

And after a delicious and very austrian dinner (we <3 Apfelstrudel), some people got back together to work on the lattice exercises!

Peace out! Good night y'all :)
