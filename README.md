# CombinatorialCoworkSpace

The website is

    stumpc5.github.io/CombinatorialCoworkSpace

and it serves the startpage `index.md`.

This page in particular loads all files in `_topics` in **lexicographic order**. You might choose to update the files in that folder to

    1_topicA.md
    2_whatwedidfriday.md
    3_nicepicsfromsundayevening.md

and so on. All files in the folder must start with two lines containing `---` for inclusion. In between, you are allowed to add parameters (but that is likely an overkill).
