## Friday, 2020-03-13

The last day dawned bright and clear, but only in our hopes and dreams. In the very last session of the workshop, 
Marta Pannizzut explained the connection between classical cubic surfaces and tropical ones, and then we heard from 
Jorge Alberto Olarte about tropical linear spaces and transversal valuated matroids. 

And suddenly it was time for many goodbyes! It has been a great week, and we personally hope to see you all soon :)

Until then,
Giulia and Lorenzo

PS: Some people were still spotted on the sun-patchworked slopes in the afternoon....
